# 🔧 Cloudinary Fix Applied!

## ✅ **ISSUE FIXED!**

The problem was that Firebase Storage was still being prioritized over Cloudinary. I've fixed this by reordering the storage providers.

## 🎯 **What I Fixed**

1. **Reordered Storage Providers**: Cloudinary is now PRIMARY
2. **Firebase is Secondary**: Only used if Cloudinary fails
3. **Local Storage**: Remains as final fallback
4. **Restarted Server**: Applied all changes

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### **Before (Broken):**
- ❌ Firebase Storage (PRIMARY) → 404 bucket error
- ❌ Cloudinary (SECONDARY) → Never used
- ❌ Local Storage (FALLBACK) → Never reached

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ **Cloudinary (PRIMARY)** → 25GB free storage
- ✅ Firebase Storage (SECONDARY) → Backup if needed
- ✅ Local Storage (FALLBACK) → Final backup

## 🧪 **Test Results**

**Storage Endpoint Response:**
```json
{
  "used_mb": 0.0,
  "total_mb": 25000.0,  // ← 25GB (Cloudinary)
  "ads_watched": 0,
  "remaining_ads": 10
}
```

**✅ Confirmed**: Cloudinary is now the primary storage!

## 🎉 **Expected Results**

## 🔍 **What Changed**

**Storage Manager Priority Order:**
1. **Cloudinary** (PRIMARY) - 25GB free
2. **Firebase** (SECONDARY) - 1GB free  
3. **Local** (FALLBACK) - Unlimited
