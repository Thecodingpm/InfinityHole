# üöÇ Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status
Railway is now using the Dockerfile (‚úÖ), but the build is still failing. I've simplified the requirements to fix dependency issues.

## What I Fixed:

### 1. Simplified Requirements
- Removed problematic packages (boto3, firebase-admin, cloudinary, google-cloud-storage)
- Kept only essential packages for basic functionality
- Removed version pinning to avoid conflicts

### 2. Optimized Dockerfile
- Better layer caching (copy requirements first)
- Added curl for debugging
- Upgraded pip before installing packages

## Next Steps:

### Option 1: Redeploy with Fixed Requirements
1. **Go to Railway dashboard**
2. **Click "Redeploy" on your failed deployment**
3. **Railway will use the updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt**
4. **Should build successfully now**

### Option 2: Check Build Logs
1. **Click "Build Logs" tab in Railway**
2. **Look for specific error messages**
3. **Share the error with me for further debugging**

### Option 3: Use Render.com (Alternative)
If Railway continues to fail:

1. **Go to [render.com](https://render.com)**
2. **Sign up with GitHub**
3. **Create "Web Service"**
4. **Connect repository:** `Thecodingpm/InfinityHole`
5. **Configure:**
   - **Root Directory:** `backend`
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `python main.py`
   - **Environment:** `Python 3`

## What the Simplified App Does:

### ‚úÖ **Working Features:**
- Video extraction from YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.
- Local video downloads
- Basic API endpoints
- Health check

### ‚ùå **Temporarily Disabled:**
- Cloud storage (Firebase, Cloudinary)
- Advanced features requiring external services

## Test Your Deployment:

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-app.railway.app/health` - Should return `{"status": "healthy"}`
- `https://your-app.railway.app/extract` - Video extraction (POST with URL)

## Add Features Back Later:

Once the basic app is working, you can gradually add back:
1. **Cloud storage** - Add firebase-admin, cloudinary back
2. **AWS S3** - Add boto3 back
3. **Google Cloud** - Add google-cloud-storage back

## Quick Commands:

```bash
# Commit the simplified requirements
git add .
git commit -m "Simplify requirements.txt for Railway deployment"
git push origin main

# Then redeploy in Railway
```

## Expected Result:
- ‚úÖ Railway builds successfully with simplified requirements
- ‚úÖ Backend runs and responds to health checks
- ‚úÖ Basic video downloading works
- ‚úÖ Frontend can connect to backend

## If Still Failing:
Share the build logs from Railway, and I'll help debug the specific error!

The simplified approach should work much better for initial deployment.
